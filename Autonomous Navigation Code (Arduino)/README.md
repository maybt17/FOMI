# Woody Code (Version 3) 
I used code from the original project to help me figure out what to use to make the ultrasonic sensors work together.
See this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TB0F_7SZHg
- woodyMoveCode.ino is what I'm using as of the time I created this repository (08/22/24)
- robotAutonomousDrive.ino is working but only incorporates 2 ultrasonic sensors vs. the 4 that the newer one uses.
