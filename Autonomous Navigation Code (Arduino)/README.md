# Woody Code (Version 3) 
- woodyMoveCode.ino is what I'm using as of the time I created this repository (08/22/24)
- robotAutonomousDrive.ino is working but only incorporates 2 ultrasonic sensors vs. the 4 that the newer one uses.
  
# Tubby Code (Version 2)
Unlike the other versions, Tubby used Python to work! I was coding directly in the Nvidia Jetson Nano so figured Python would work! The reason Woody runs off of Arduino (which uses a variant of C++) is because I am currently using an Arduino to control movement and the Nano to manage the mapping. This will be changed in the future.
