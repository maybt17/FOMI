# FOMI (Future of Movement Independence) / Autonomous Wheelchair Project

Introduction

In 2021, I had just entered the 9th grade. My school does a system of 'pathways'– specialized STEM courses directed at certain fields of study –(engineering, biomed, & media tech) and I was entering my first year in the engineering course. In 9th grade, I took a class called 'Introduction to Engineering' where we learned a little bit of everything. 

One of our little snippets, was a short project asking us to research a medical issue, brainstorm, and prototype something that could alleviate this condition. My partner and I, after much contemplating, decided to focus on paralysis. We wanted to come up with a way to provide people with limited mobility, more independence, so that they could more easily move around themselves and not depend on others to assist them. 

While taking turns brainstorming, I came up with the idea of combining mapping with an electric wheelchair. I had seen videos of Roomba vaccum cleaners mapping out house layouts and autonomously moving to do their tasks. I thought, "why can't this be applied to a wheelchair?" The idea was to have a little robot that would map a user's house, work place, etc. and then the user (or a helper to the user) would be able to interact with the mapping results to mark keypoints on the map. For example, marking the bathroom sink, desks, living room couches, beds, and anything important to get directly to. Then the bot would hook up to the wheelchair and together they would work to bring the user to their desired location.

Since 9th grade I've been working on this project. My partner and I carried it to 10th grade where we took it up for our Cornerstone project (cornerstone is basically like capstone, except highschool versioned). We got it to a place where the robot used LiDAR to (poorly) map a (small) space. After that, my partner dropped the project but I still work on it to this day. I'm now a 12th grader.
