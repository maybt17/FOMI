# FOMI (Future of Movement Independence) / Autonomous Wheelchair Project

## Introduction

In 2021, I had just entered the 9th grade. My school does a system of 'pathways'– specialized STEM courses directed at certain fields of study –(engineering, biomed, & media tech) and I was entering my first year in the engineering course. In 9th grade, I took a class called 'Introduction to Engineering' where we learned a little bit of everything. 

One of our little snippets, was a short project asking us to research a medical issue, brainstorm, and prototype something that could alleviate this condition. My partner and I, after much contemplating, decided to focus on paralysis. We wanted to come up with a way to provide people with limited mobility, more independence, so that they could more easily move around themselves and not depend on others to assist them. 

While taking turns brainstorming, I came up with the idea of combining mapping with an electric wheelchair. I had seen videos of Roomba vaccum cleaners mapping out house layouts and autonomously moving to do their tasks. I thought, "why can't this be applied to a wheelchair?" The idea was to have a little robot that would map a user's house, work place, etc. and then the user (or a helper to the user) would be able to interact with the mapping results to mark keypoints on the map. For example, marking the bathroom sink, desks, living room couches, beds, and anything important to get directly to. Then the bot would hook up to the wheelchair and together they would work to bring the user to their desired location.

Since 9th grade I've been working on this project. My partner and I carried it to 10th grade where we took it up for our Cornerstone project (cornerstone is basically like capstone, except highschool versioned). We got it to a place where the robot used LiDAR to (poorly) map a (small) space. After that, my partner dropped the project but I still work on it to this day. I'm now a 12th grader.

For a further overview of the process (prior) to updating GitHub, look below.

## What Was Done Before I Joined Github
For more in depth, I highly recommend checking out the links above.

I decided it would be best to start with the mapping robot because it would be the brain of the system (and I really wanted to learn how to build a robot). This was our first iteration, dubbed 'Sharon'. She was powered with an Arduino Uno, an old battery pack, an ultrasonic sensor, and a whole lot of messy wires. The bot was a simple robot from an old cutting board, that could autonomously drive around. It worked pretty well but it was only the first step.

Next up, I decided to spend some money on a LiDAR sensor off of Amazon and an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, which was basically a mini computer that runs Ubuntu, maybe you could call it Raspberry Pi's older sibling. Not sure. But it was a huge step up because it took a LONG time to figure it out. With out new tech, this is what we got for our presentation in 10th grade for our cornerstone. This one could map (semi) succesfully and was controlled by an Xbox One controller. This one is dubbed Tubby (short for 'Tupperware').

This is what I have at the time of writing this (08/22/24), a much different iteration. It can autonomously drive around very well with what it has, has stronger motors, stronger motor drivers, a larger battery, an even bigger mess (in a good way!), and... it's mapping is still about the same, not great but not good. There is a lot of controversy over its name, so this one is also Sharon (named after the OG) but has the nickname, Woody.
